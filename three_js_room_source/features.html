    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Most of the models, anything loaded with the GLTF loader, is made in blender by me. The fire is made with some 
    fire colored cones moving up and down based on some perlin noise, and also moving in a circular pattern perpindicular to the up axis.
    The movement is based off perlin noise, instead of random numbers, to give it some sort of consistency to the random values from one frame 
    to the next. The light from the flame is the average position and brightness of all the particles. That is why the shadows dance around. Since 
    the position of the fire particles aren't random, there is a nice consistency to the shadows. The lamp is stationary, so its shadows do not move.
    <br><br>
    Although the window looks bright, it only exists as a reason for the ambient light to exist. The trickiest part of this assignment was getting
    the fire to have a bloom effect, while also having the window and lamp to not be too "bright." This requires an initial rendering of just the fire
    particles to a texture, and then applying bloom to the texture. After, the rest of the scene is rendered. Then the bloom effect from the fire particles 
    is overlayed on the rendered scene, and displayed to the viewer. 
    <br><br>
    Three.js made all of this fairly easy to do, and it probably runs on any computer
    that can run minecraft. I made some optimizations, but a very solid chunk of the time is devoted to rendering the shadows, which could have been lower quality,
    but my computer can run it, so it's good enough. </p>
