TO SEE THIS CODE RUN GO TO  https://people.ucsc.edu/~swortzma/driver.html

This is just the source code, modules dont work local!

I did not make Three.js (duh), fire.ogg , or floor_normal.jpg / floor.jpg. 
Everything else is made by me in blender or javascript.

I am really proud of the fire that I made, It uses perlin noise and three.js cone shape to make a fairly good looking fire. I had
about a week to work on this project, we were givin two weeks, but I was going to be in yosemite for the second week.
