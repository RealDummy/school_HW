    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>Change "Edge Count" to change the number of polygons each cylinder has. Click and drag to rotate the object. Change the sliders for the
        directional light to change where the directional light is coming from, and change its RGB value with the RGB sliders. Similarly, change the 
        position and color of the point light, depicted as a sphere, with the point light sliders. Both lights are able to be toggled. Also the further
        away the point light is, the dimmer it gets, so don't be alarmed if you can't notice the effects of a far away point light.
